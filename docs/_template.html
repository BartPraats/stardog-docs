      <header><h1>Introduction</h1></header>

      <p>PelletServer is a framework that's optimized for building
      integration and analysis applications, primarily using Semantic Web
      technologies&mdash;including SPARQL, RDF, and OWL. PelletServer
      provides programmatic access via a simple REST interface. In most
      cases, accessing PelletServer's services is as simple as issuing an
      HTTP GET. While most of PelletServer's capabilities are implemented
      in Java&mdash;which means that programming with them requires
      programming in Java&mdash;the REST interface makes them universally
      accessible.</p>

      <h2>Focus on the Data: PelletServer</h2>

      <p>PelletServer is a backend system that provides data and
      computational services for frontend or user-facing system
      components; it contains a simple user interface for
      administrative functions, but its not intended to be directly
      user-facing. Because PelletServer is based entirely on REST, any
      competent, modern web app framework will integrate cleanly with
      it: Rails, Django, Lift, Pylons, Node.js-based systems, etc.</p>

      <h2>Focus on the User: Pelorus &amp; Annex</h2>

      <p>If you're looking for web tools optimized for semantic
      technology, Clark &amp; Parsia's core web app offerings are
      integrated with PelletServer:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><a href=http://clarkparsia.com/pelorus>Pelorus</a>: a web-based faceted browser</li>
        <li><a href=http://clarkparsia.com/annex>Annex</a>: a
        JavaScript-centric Linked Data and web app framework</li>
      </ol>

<section><header><h1>Design Goals</h1></header>

<p>The design goals and constraints of PelletServer include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Integration</b>. The power of Semantic Web technologies lies
    primarily in their ability to accelerate information integration
    and analysis. And web technologies are already the basis of most
    integration efforts.  PelletServer blends the best semantic and
    web technologies into a single, coherent framework.</li>
  <li><b>Universal Access</b>. Most Semantic Web software is built
  with Java. But what about Ruby, Python, JavaScript, C#, etc?
  Since HTTP is the universal access layer, PelletServer provides programmatic
  access to its services via RESTful HTTP.</li>
  <li><b>Simplicity</b>. We've applied conventions and sane defaults
  aggressively in the design and implementation of PelletServer; most
  services are accessed as easily as
    <pre><code>$ wget http://example.com/kb/wine/consistency</code></pre>   </li>
  <li><b>Standards Compliance</b>. We built PelletServer using
  standards and standard-compliant components, including HTTP,
  SPARQL, OWL, RDF, AMQP, and JSON.</li>
  <li><b>Performance</b>. Since many of our commercial products are
  based on computationally complex algorithms, we can't afford to
  ignore performance. So we designed PelletServer to be multi-machine,
  distributed, asynchronous, and cloud-friendly from the
  beginning. PelletServer uses
  <a href=http://www.amqp.org/>AMQP</a><n>Both asynchronous HTTP
  interaction and distributed AMQP services are scheduled for
  PelletServer 1.0 release.</n> internally to manage communications
  between distributed systems. The HTTP interface uses asynchronous
  patterns of client-server interaction when requests can't be
  computed in a few seconds.</li>
  <li><b>URL Agnosticism.</b> Some people naturally think of HTTP-based
  information integration from the resource-centric perspective. In
  that view, URLs identify resources, i.e., primarily data
  resources. Other people naturally think of URLs as identifying
  services, i.e., computational artifacts which take data as
  arguments. We think both perspectives are valuable; while
  PelletServer's out-of-the-box URL design is resource-centric, we
  provide a mechanism to rewrite PelletServer URLs dynamically in
  either style.<n>In service-centric style, the example above looks
  like <pre><code>$ wget http://www.example.com/consistency/wine</code></pre></n></li>
</ul>
