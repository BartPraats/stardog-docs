  <p>In this chapter we discuss how to administer a Stardog Server
and Stardog databases, chiefly by way of discussing how to use the
various Stardog command-line programs. An important part of Stardog
administration is security, which is discussed in a separate, dedicated <a
href="../security">chapter</a>.</p>

    <section id="cli"><header><h1 id="chapter">CLI Overview</h1></header>

    <p>Stardog's command-line interface (CLI) comes in two parts:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><tt>stardog-admin</tt>: admininstrative client (uses HTTP or SNARL)</li>
      <li><tt>stardog</tt>: a user's client (uses HTTP or SNARL)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The admin and user's tools operate on local or remote databases,
using either HTTP or SNARL Protocols. Both of these CLI tools are Unix-only,
are self-documenting, and the help output of these tools is their canonical
documentation. The documentation of these tools in this chapter goes into
more detail, offers background, etc. But if there is a conflict between
this documentation and the output of the CLI tools' "help" command, the CLI
tools' output is correct.</p>

    <p>To use the Stardog CLI tools, you can start by asking them to display help:</p>

    <pre><code>$ stardog help</code></pre>

    <p>Or:</p>

    <pre><code>$ stardog-admin help</code></pre>

    <p>The rationale for separating functionality into two CLI programs is
largely based on security, since <tt>stardog-admin</tt> will need to have
considerably tighter access restrictions than <tt>stardog</tt>.</p>

    <blockquote><b>SECURITY NOTICE</b>: <u>For usability, Stardog
@@VERSION@@ provides a default user "admin" and password "admin" in
<tt>stardog-admin</tt> commands if no user or password are given. This
is obviously <b>not secure</b>; before any serious use of Stardog
is contemplated, read the <a href="../security">security</a>
chapter at least twice, and then&mdash;minimally&mdash;change the
administrative password to something we haven't published on the
interwebs!</u></blockquote>

    <h2>How to Make a Connection String</h2>

    <p>Some CLI subcommands require a Stardog connection string as an
argument to identify the server and database upon which operations are to
be performed. Connection strings are URLs and may either be local to the
machine where the CLI is run or they may be on some other remote machine.
There are two URL schemes recognized by Stardog: <tt>http://</tt> and
<tt>snarl://</tt>. The former uses Stardog's (extended) version of SPARQL
Protocol; the latter uses Stardog's native data access protocol, called
SNARL, which is based on Google's Protocol Buffers.</p>

    <p>Note: <tt>stardog-admin</tt> uses SNARL Protocol only; it will not work with or recognize HTTP connection strings. <tt>stardog</tt> user's client works with HTTP or SNARL Protocol, interchangeably.<n>SNARL is faster than HTTP in cases where payloads to and from the server are relatively <em>small</em>; for payloads that are large, raw transfer time dominates and there isn't much or any difference in performance.</n></p>

    <h3>Example Connection Strings</h3>

  <p>To make a connection string, you need to know the URL scheme; the machine name and port the Stardog  Server is running on; any (optional) URL path to the database (it's very unlikely you'll need this); and the name of the database:</p>

  <pre><code>{scheme}{machineName}:{port}/{databaseName};{connectionOptions}</code></pre>

  <pre><code>snarl://server/billion-triples-punk</code></pre>

  <pre><code>http://localhost:5000/myDatabase</code></pre>

  <pre><code>http://169.175.100.5:1111/myOtherDatabase;reasoning=QL</code></pre>

  <pre><code>snarl://stardog:8888/the_database</code></pre>

  <pre><code>snarl://localhost:1024/db1;reasoning=NONE</code></pre>

  <p>Using the default ports for SNARL and HTTP protocols simplifies connection strings. <code>connectionOptions</code> are a series of <code>;</code> delimited key-value pairs
  which themselves are <code>=</code> delimited.  key names must be <b>lowercase</b> and their values are case-sensitive.</p>

</section>

<div><span><a name="admin-server"></a></span></div>
<section id="admin-server"><header><h1 id="chapter">Administering a Stardog Server</h1></header>

    <p>Stardog Server is multi-protocol beast: it supports both SNARL and HTTP protocols. The default port for SNARL is <b>5820</b>; the default port for HTTP is <b>5822</b>. <b>As of Stardog 1.0.1, all administrative functions work over SNARL or HTTP protocols.</b></p>

    <p>To use any of these commands against a remote server, pass a <tt>--server</tt> argument with an HTTP or SNARL URL.</p>

    <p><b>Note</b>: If you are running <tt>stardog-admin</tt> on the same machine where Stardog Server is running, and you're using the default protocol ports, then you can omit the <tt>--server</tt> argument and simply pass a database name via <tt>-n</tt> option. Most of the following commands assume this case for simplicity of exposition.</p>

    <h2>Configuring Stardog Server Behavior</h2>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: the properties described in this section control the behavior of the Stardog Server (whether HTTP or SNARL protocols are in use); to set properties or other metadata on individual Stardog <em>databases</em>, see <a href="#admin-database">Administering a Database</a>.</p>

    <p>Stardog Server's behavior can be configured via the JVM
<tt>stardog.home</tt>, which sets Stardog Home, overriding the value of
<tt>STARDOG_HOME</tt> set as an environment variable. Stardog Server's behavior
can also be configured via a <tt>stardog.properties</tt>&mdash;which is a Java
Properties file&mdash;file in <tt>STARDOG_HOME</tt>. To change the behavior of a
running Stardog Server, it is necessary to shut it down and restart it.</p>

    <p>The following properties that determine aspects of Stardog Server's behavior are available in
    <tt>stardog.properties</tt>:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><tt>strict.parsing</tt>: Controls whether Stardog parses RDF strictly (<tt>true</tt>, the default) or laxly (<tt>false</tt>)</li>
      <li><tt>query.all.graphs</tt>: Controls what Stardog Server queries over; if <tt>true</tt>, it will query over the default graph and the union of all named graphs; if <tt>false</tt> (the default), it will query only over the default graph.</li>
      <li><tt>query.timeout</tt>: Sets the upper bound for query execution time that's inherited by all databases unless explicitly overriden. See <a href="#manage-queries">Query Management</a> section below for details.</li>
      <li><tt>logging.[access,audit].[enabled,type,file]</tt>: Controls whether and how Stardog logs server events; described in detail below.</li>
      <li><tt>logging.slow_query.enabled</tt></li>
      <li><tt>logging.slow_query.time</tt></li>
      <li><tt>logging.slow_query.type</tt>: The three slow query logging options are used in the following way. To enable logging of slow queries, set <tt>enabled</tt> to <tt>true</tt>. To define what counts as a "slow" query, set <tt>time</tt> to a time duration value (positive integer plus "h", "m", "s", or "ms" for hours, minutes, seconds, or milliseconds respectively). To determine the type of logging, set <tt>type</tt> to <tt>text</tt> (the default) or <tt>binary</tt>. <strong>To state the obvious explicitly, a <tt>logging.slow_query.time</tt> that exceeds the value of <tt>query.timeout</tt> will result in null logs.</li>
      <li><tt>database.connection.timeout.ms</tt>: Controls how long, in milliseconds,connections may idle before being automatically closed by the server. </li>
      <li><tt>http.max.connections</tt>: The next two parameters control the maximum number of simultaneous connections for a client; for more information, see the <a href=" http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/tutorial/html/connmgmt.html">relevant Apache docs</a>.</li>
      <li><tt>http.max.connections.per.route</tt></li>
      <li><tt>http.max.get.query.length</tt>: The length in characters of the longest SPARQL query that will be serialized via HTTP <tt>GET</tt>; queries longer are serialized via <tt>POST</tt>.</li>
      <li><tt>bnode.preserve.id</tt>: Determines how the Stardog parser handles bnode identifiers
that may be present in (some) RDF input. If this property is enabled (i.e., <tt>TRUE</tt>), parsing
and data loading performance are improved; but the other effect is that  if distinct input files use
(randomly or intentionally) the same bnode identifier, that bnode will point to one and the same
node in the database. If you have input files that use explicit bnode identifiers, and multiple
files may use the asame bnode idenitifers, and you don't want those bnodes to be smushed into a
single node in the database, then this configuration option should be disabled (set to
<tt>FALSE</tt>). </li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Starting and Stopping the Server</h2>

    <p><b>Note</b>: Unlike the other <tt>stardog-admin</tt> subcommands, starting and stopping the server may only be run locally, i.e., on the same machine as Stardog Server will run on.</p>

    <p>The simplest way to start the server&mdash;running on the default ports, detaching to run as a daemon, and writing <tt>stardog.pid</tt> and <tt>stardog.log</tt> to the current working directory&mdash; is</p>

    <pre><code>$ stardog-admin server start</code></pre>

    <p>To specify parameters:</p>

    <pre><code>$ stardog-admin --logfile=stardog.log server start --no-docs --http=80 </code></pre>

    <p><tt>--no-docs</tt> will tell Stardog not to serve its documentation over HTTP at <tt>http://SERVER/docs</tt>, which it will otherwise do by default.</p>

    <p>To shut down the server:</p>

    <pre><code>$ stardog-admin server stop</code></pre>

    <p>Note: ports can be specified using the properties <tt>--snarl</tt> and <tt>--http</tt>. The HTTP interface can be disabled by
using the flag <tt>--no-http</tt>; the SNARL interface may not be disabled.</p>

    <h2>Serving Stardog Documentation</h2>

    <p>By default, if you start Stardog Server with HTTP enabled, then
Stardog will serve the system documentation at <tt>http://SERVER/docs</tt>,
which is the reason "docs" is a reserved database name. In a production
deployment, you might want to disable documentation serving, which you can
do by passing <tt>--no-docs</tt> on server startup or by disabling HTTP
altogether.</p>

    <h2>Locking Stardog Home</h2>

    <p>Stardog Server will lock <tt>STARDOG_HOME</tt> when it starts to prevent synchronization errors and other nasties if you start more than one Stardog Server with the same <tt>STARDOG_HOME</tt>. If you need to run more than one Stardog Server instance, choose a different <tt>STARDOG_HOME</tt> or pass a different value to <tt>--home</tt>.</p>


    <h2>Access and Audit Logging</h2>

    <p>See <tt>stardog.properties</tt> for a complete discussion of how
access and audit logging work in Stardog Server. Basically, audit logging
is a superset of the events in access logging. Access logging covers the
most commonly required logging events; you should consider enabling audit
logging if you really need to log <em>every</em> every server event. Logging
generally doesn't have a statistically significant impact on performance;
but the safest way to insure that is the case is to log to a separate disk
(or to a centralized logging server altogether, etc.).</p>

<p>The important configuration choices are whether logs should be binary
or plain text (both based on ProtocolBuffer message formats); the type of
logging (audit or access); the logging location (which may be "off disk" or
even "off machine"<n>Logging to a centralized logging facility requires a
Java plugin that implements the Stardog Server logging interface; see the
<a href="../java/">Java Chapter</a> for more information); and the log
rotation policy (file size or time).</p>

      <h2>Configuring a Database</h2>

      <p>To administer a Stardog database, some config options must be
set at creation time; others may be changed subsequently, while yet may
never be changed. All of the config options have sensible defaults (except,
obviously, for database name), so you don't have to twiddle any of the knobs
till you really need to.</p>

      <h3>Configuration Options</h3>

      <p>The following are the legal configuration options for a Stardog database:</p>

      <dl>
<dt>database.name</dt>
<dd> A legal database name.</dd>

<dt>database.online</dt>
<dd> The status of the database: online or offline. It may be set so that
the database is created initially in online or offline status;
subsequently, it can't be set directly but only by using the relevant admin commands.</dd>

<dt>icv.active.graphs</dt>
<dd> Specifies which part of the database, in terms of named graphs, is
checked with IC validation. to
validate all the named graphs in the database.</dd>

<dt>icv.enabled</dt>
<dd> Determines whether ICV is active for the database; if true, all database
mutations are subject to IC validation (i.e., "guard mode").</dd>

<dt>icv.reasoning-type</dt>
<dd> Determines what "reasoning level" is used during IC validation.</dd>

<dt>index.differential.enable.limit</dt>
<dd> Sets the minimum size of the Stardog database before differential indexes are used.</dd>

<dt>index.differential.merge.limit</dt>
<dd> Sets the size in number of RDF triples before the differential indexes are merged to the main indexes.</dd>

<dt>index.literals.canonical</dt>
<dd> Enables RDF literal canonicalization. See <a href="../java/snarl/com/clarkparsia/stardog/index/IndexOptions.html#CANONICAL_LITERALS">literal canonicalization</a> for details.</dd>

<dt>index.named.graphs</dt>
<dd> Enables optimized index support for named graphs; speeds SPARQL query evaluation with named graphs at the cost of some overhead for database loading and index maintenance.</dd>

<dt>index.persist</dt>
<dd> Enables persistent indexes.</dd>

<dt>index.persist.sync</dt>
<dd> Enables whether memory indexes are synchronously or asynchronously persisted to disk with respect to a transaction.</dd>

<dt>index.statistics.update.automatic</dt>
<dd> Sets whether statistics are maintained automatically.</dd>

<dt>index.type</dt>
<dd> Sets the index type (memory or disk).</dt>

<dt>reasoning.consistency.automatic</dt>
<dd> Enables automatic consistency checking with respect to a transaction.</dt>

<dt>reasoning.punning.enabled</dt>
<dd> Enables punning.</dt>

<dt>reasoning.schema.graphs</dt>
<dd> Determines which, if any, named graph or graphs contains the "tbox", i.e., the schema part of the data.</dt>

<dt>search.enabled</dt>
<dd> Enables semantic search on the database.</dt>

<dt>search.reindex.mode</dt>
<dd> Sets how search indexes are maintained.</dt>

<dt>transactions.durable</dt>
<dd> Enables durable transactions.</dt>

      </dl>

      <h4>A Note About Database Status</h4>

      <p>As of Stardog @@VERSION@@, a database must be set to
<tt>offline</tt> status before most configuration parameters may be changed.
So the routine is to set the database offline, change the parameters
programmatically, and the set the database to online. All of these
operations may be done programmatically from CLI tools, such that they can
be scripted in advance to minimize downtime.<n>In a future version, we will
allow some properties to be set while the database remains online.</n></p>

    <h2>Managing Database Status</h2>

    <p>Databases are either online or offline; this allows database maintenance to be decoupled from server maintenance.</p>

    <h3>Online and Offline Strategies</h3>

    <p>Databases may be put into online or offline status via one of two strategies.</p>

    <p>For moving from offline to online:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><tt>wait</tt>: Blocks till all database startup jobs and activities are completed; database is offline till all such jobs have completed.</li>
      <li><tt>nowait</tt>: Database comes online more quickly, non-essential startup and other jobs are performed asynchronously.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For moving from online to offline:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><tt>wait</tt>: No new connections to the database are allowed; pending jobs are unscheduled; open connections and running jobs are allowed to finish up to a timeout value; the default timeout value is 180 seconds.</li>
      <li><tt>nowait</tt>: No new connections to the database are allowed; pending jobs are unscheduled; open connections and running jobs are allowed to finish up to a timeout value: the <em>fixed</em> timeout value for <tt>nowait</tt> is 0 seconds.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>By default, the online strategy for a database is <tt>wait</tt>.</p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <p>To set a database from offline to online:</p>

    <pre><code>$ stardog-admin offline -n my_db_name</code></pre>

    <p>To set the database offline without waiting:</p>

    <pre><code>$ stardog-admin offline --nowait -n my_db_name</code></pre>

    <p>To set the database online:</p>

    <pre><code>$ stardog-admin online -n my_db_name</code></pre>

    <p>If Stardog Server is shutdown while a database is offline, the database
will be offline the next time the server starts.</p>

        <div><span><a name="create"></a></span></div>
        <h2>Creating a Database</h2>

    <p>Stardog databases may be created locally or remotely; but, of course,
performance is better if the data files don't have to be transferred over
a network.<n>See the section below about loading compressed data.</n> All
data files, indexes, and server metadata for the new database will be stored
in Stardog Home. Stardog won't create a database with the same name as an
existing database.<n>Stardog database names must conform to the regular
expression, <tt>[A-Za-z]{1}[A-Za-z0-9_-] </tt>.</n></p>

  <p><b>Note: there are three reserved words that may not be used for the
  names of Stardog databases:</b> <tt>system</tt>, <tt>admin</tt>, and
  <tt>docs</tt>.</p>

    <p>Minimally, the only thing you must know to create a Stardog database
is a database <i>name</i>; alternately, you may customize some other
database parameters and options depending on anticipated workloads, data
modeling, and other factors.</p>

   <h3>Persisting and Managing Namespace Prefix Bindings</h3>

   <p>SPARQL queries can become verbose because of the (often redundant)
<tt>PREFIX</tt> declarations in the prologue of each query. Stardog allows
database administrators to persist and manage custom namespace prefix
bindings, which works in the following way:</p>

<ol>

  <li>At database creation time, if data is loaded to the database that
  contains namespace prefixes, then those are persisted for the life of
  the database. Any subsequent queries to the database may simply omit the
  <tt>PREFIX</tt> declarations:

    <pre><code>$ ./stardog query -c snarl://localhost/myDB -q "select * {?s rdf:type owl:Class}"</code></pre>

  </li>

  <li>To add new bindings, use the <tt>namespace</tt> subcommand in the CLI:

    <pre><code>$ ./stardog namespace add --prefix ex --uri \
      'http://example.org/test#' -c snarl://localhost/myDB</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li>To modify an existing binding, delete the existing one and then add a new one:</li>

  <pre><code>$ ./stardog namespace remove --prefix ex -c snarl://localhost/myDB</code></pre>

  </li>

  <li>Finally, to see all of the existing namespace prefix bindings:

  <pre><code>$ ./stardog namespace list snarl://localhost/myDB</code></pre>

</ol>

  <p>If no files are used during database creation, or if the files do not
  define any prefixes (e.g. NTriples), then the "Big Four" default prefixes
  are stored: RDF, RDFS, XSD, and OWL.</p>

  <p>When executing queries in the CLI, the default table format for
SPARQL <tt>SELECT</tt> results will use the bindings as qnames. SPARQL
<tt>CONSTRUCT</tt> query output (including export) will also use the stored
prefixes.</p>

  <p>Finally, to reiterate, namespace prefix bindings are <em>per
database</em>, not global, in nature.</p>

   <h3>Database Creation Templates</h3>

      <p>As a boon to the overworked admin or devops peeps, Stardog Server
supports a feature we call "database creation templates", which is to say
that you can pass a Java Properties file with config values set and with
the values (typically just the database name) that are unique to a specific
database passed in CLI parameters.</p>

  <h3>Examples</h3>

  <p>To create a new database with the default options by simply
providing a name and a set of initial datasets to load:</p>

  <pre><code>$ stardog-admin create -n my-database input.ttl another_file.rdf moredata.rdf.gz</code></pre>

  <p>Datasets can be loaded later as well, though bulk loading at creation time is the fastest way to load data.</p>

  <p>To create (in this case, an empty) database from a template file:</p>

  <pre><code>$ stardog-admin create -c database.properties</code></pre>

  <p>At a minimum, the configuration file must have a value for <tt>database.name</tt> option.</p>

  <p>Finally, if you only want to change only a few configuration options you can directly provide the values for these options in the CLI args
as follows:</p>

  <pre><code>$ stardog-admin create -n db1 -o icv.enabled=true icv.reasoning.type=QL -- input.ttl</code></pre>

  <p>Note that '--' is used in this case when -o is the last option to delimit the value for -o from the files to be bulk loaded.</p>

  <p>Please refer to the CLI help for more details of the <tt>create</tt> subcommand.</p>

  <a name="index-strategies"></a>
  <h3>Index Strategies</h3>

<p>By default, Stardog builds extra indexes for named graphs. These
additional indexes are used when SPARQL queries specify datasets using <tt>FROM</tt> and
<tt>FROM NAMED</tt>. With these additional indexes, better statistics about
named graphs are also computed.</p>

<p>Stardog may also be configured to create and to use fewer indexes, if the database is
only going to be used to store RDF triples, that is, will not be used to store named graph information. In this mode, Stardog will maintain fewer indexes, which will
result in faster database creation and faster updates without
compromising query answering performance. In such databases, quads (that is: triples with named
graphs or contexts specified) may still be added to these database at any time, but query performance may degrade in such cases.</p>

<p>To create a database which indexes only RDF triples, set the option
<tt>index.named.graphs</tt> to <tt>false</tt> at database creation time. The CLI provides
a shorthand option&mdash;<tt>-i</tt> or <tt>--index-triples-only</tt>&mdash;which is equivalent.</p>

<p>Please note that this option can only be set at database creation time and
cannot be changed later without rebuilding the database, so use this
option with caution.</p>

<h3>Differential Indexes</h3>

<p>While Stardog is generally biased in favor of read (i.e., query) performance, write performance is also important in many applications. In order to increase write performance, Stardog may be used, optionally, with a <em>differential index</em>.

<p>Stardog's differential index is used to persist additions and removals
separately from the main indexes, such that updates to the database can be
performed faster. Query answering takes into consideration all the
data stored in the main indexes and the differential index; hence, query
answers are computed as if all the data is stored in the main indexes.

<p>There is a slight overhead for query answering with differential indexes if
the differential index size gets too large. For this reason, the
differential index is merged into the main indexes when its size reaches
the <tt>DIFF_INDEX_MAX_LIMIT</tt>. There is no benefit of differential indexes
if the main index itself is small. For this reason, the
differential index is not used until the main index size reaches
<tt>DIFF_INDEX_MAX_LIMIT</tt>.</p>

<p>In most cases, the default value of the <tt>DIFF_INDEX_MAX_LIMIT</tt> parameter will work fine and doesn't need to be changed.<n>The corrollary of this claim is that you shouldn't change this value in a production system till you've tested the effects of a change in a non-production system.</n>

    <div><span><a name="compressed"></a></span></div>
    <h2>Using Compressed Data</h2>

    <p>Stardog supports loading data from compressed files directly so there
is no need to uncompress files before loading. Compressed input is
actually typically faster to load since it minimizes disk access so
the recommended way to load large input files is to load them in
compressed format.</p>

<p>Stardog supports GZIP and ZIP compressions natively. If a file name
passed to create or add commands (through CLI or API) will be
interpreted to be a gzip file if the file name ends with '.gz'. The
RDF format of the file is determined by the extension that comes
before '.gz'. So, if a file named 'test.ttl.gz' is used as input,
Stardog will perform gzip decompression during loading and parse the
file with Turtle parser. All the formats supported by Stardog
(RDF/XML, Turtle, Trig, etc.) can be used with gzip compression.</p>

<p>The zip support works differently since zipped files can contain
multiple files inside. When an input file name ends with '.zip',
Stardog performs zip decompression and tries to load all the files
inside the zip file. The RDF format of the files inside the zip file
is determined by their file names as usual. If there is an
unrecognized file extension (e.g. '.txt') that file will be skipped.</p>

    <h2>Dropping a Database</h2>

    <p>This command removes a database and all associated files and
metadata. As with <tt>create</tt>, this command may work against a database
directly or via a running Stardog server. <tt>drop</tt> operates without
regard to pending writes or queries. Only use <tt>drop</tt> when you're
certain!</p>

<p>It takes as its only argument a valid database name. For example,</p>

<pre><code>$ stardog-admin drop -n my_db_name</code></pre>

    <h2>Using Integrity Constraint Validation</h2>

    <p>Stardog supports integrity constraint validation as a data quality
mechanism via closed world reasoning. Constraints can be specified in OWL,
SWRL, and SPARQL.</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="../sdp">ICV chapter</a> for more about using
ICV in Stardog programmatically.</p>

    <p>The CLI <tt>icv</tt> subcommand can be used to add, delete, or drop
all constraints from an existing database. It may also be used to validate
an existing database with constraints that are passed into the <tt>icv</tt>
subcommand; that is, using different constraints than the ones already
associated with the database.</p>

  <p>CLI also supports a command, <tt>icv export</tt>, that will return the
equivalent SPARQL queries to some constraints; this is useful if you want to
see what a constraint means in terms of a query or if you want to feed those
queries to some other RDF database for execution. See</p>

<pre><code>./stardog help icv convert</code></pre>

<p>for more information about this feature.</p>

    <p>For ICV in transacted mutations of Stardog databases, see the
database creation section above.</p>

    <h2>Migrating a Database</h2>

    <p>The <tt>migrate</tt> subcommand migrates an older Stardog database to
the latest @@VERSION@@ of Stardog. Its only argument is the name of the database
to migrate. <tt>migrate</tt> won't necessarily work between arbitrary
Stardog version, so before upgrading check the release notes for a new
version carefully to see whether migration is required or possible.</p>

  <pre><code>$ stardog-admin migrate -n myDatabase</code></pre>

<p>will update <tt>myDatabase</tt> to the latest database format.</p>

  <h2>Getting Database Information</h2>

  <p>You can get some information about a database (online/offline status,
creation time, last modification time, etc.) by running the following
command:</p>

  <pre><code>$ stardog-admin get -n my_db_name</code></pre>

  <p>This will return all the metadata stored about the database, including
the values of configuration options used for this database instance.
If you want to get the value for a specific option then you can run
the following command:</p>

  <pre><code>$ stardog-admin get -o index.named.graphs -n my_db_name</code></pre>

<h2 id="manage-queries">Managing Queries</h2>

<p>Stardog includes the capability to manage running queries according to configurable policies set at run-time; this capability includes support for</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>listing</b> running queries;</li>
  <li><b>deleting</b> running queries;</li>
  <li><b>reading</b> the status of a running query;</li>
  <li><b>killing</b> running queries that exceed a time threshold automatically;</li>
  <li><b>logging</b> slow queries for analysis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stardog is pre-configured with sensible <i>server-wide</i> defaults for query management parameters; these defaults may be overridden or disabled per database.</p>

<h3>Configuring Query Management</h3>

<p>For many uses cases the default configuration will be sufficient. But you may need to tweak the timeout parameter to be longer or shorter, depending on the data load, queries, throughput, etc. The default configuration has a server-wide query timeout value of <tt>query.timeout</tt>, which is inherited by all the databases in the server. You can customize the server-wide timeout value and then set per-database custom values, too. Any database without a custom value inherits the server-wide value. To disable query timeout, set <tt>query.timeout</tt> to <tt>0</tt>.</p>

<h3>Command-line Tools</h3>

<p>The query management command-line tools are simple and easy to use.</p>

<h4>Listing Queries</h4>

<p>To see all running queries, use the <tt>query list</tt> subcommand:</p>

<pre><code>-> % ./stardog-admin query list</code></pre>

<p>The results are formatted tabularly:</p>

<pre><code>+----+----------+-------+--------------+
| ID | Database | User  | Elapsed time |
+----+----------+-------+--------------+
| 2  | test     | admin | 00:00:20.165 |
| 3  | test     | admin | 00:00:16.223 |
| 4  | test     | admin | 00:00:08.769 |
+----+----------+-------+--------------+

3 queries running</code></pre>

<p>You can see the user who owns the query (superuser's can see all running queries), as well as the elapsed time and the database against which the query is running. The ID column is the key to deleting queries.</p>

<h4>Deleting Queries</h4>

<p>To delete a running query, simply pass its ID to the <tt>query kill</tt> subcommand:</p>

<pre><code>-> % ./stardog-admin query kill 3</code></pre>

<p>The output confirms the query kill completing successfully:</p>

<pre><code>Query 3 killed successfully</code></pre>

<h4>Automatically Killing Queries</h4>

<p>For production use, especially when a Stardog database is exposed to arbitrary query input, some of which may not execute in an acceptable time period, the automatic query killing feature is useful. It will protect a Stardog Server from queries consuming too many resources.</p>

<p>Once the execution time of a query exceeds the value of <tt>query.timeout</tt>, the query will be killed automatically. The client that submitted the query will receive an error message. The value of <tt>query.timeout</tt> may be overriden by setting a different value (smaller or longer) in database options. To disable, set to <tt>query.timeout</tt> to <tt>0</tt>.</p>

<p>The value of <tt>query.timeout</tt> is a positive integer concated with a letter, all of which is interpreted as a time duration: 'h' (for hours), 'm' (for minutes), 's' (for seconds, )or 'ms' (for milliseconds). For example, '1h' for 1 hour, '5m' for 5 minutes, '90s' for 90 seconds, and '500ms' for 500 milliseconds.</p>

<p>The default, out-of-the-box value of <tt>query.timeout</tt> is five minutes.</p>

<h4>Query Status</h4>

<p>To see more detail about one running query, use the <tt>query status</tt> subcommand:</p>

<pre><code>-> % ./stardog-admin query status 1</code></pre>

<p>The resulting output includes query metadata, including the query itself:</p>

<pre><code>Username: admin
Database: test
Started : 2013-02-06 09:10:45 AM
Elapsed : 00:01:19.187
Query   :
select ?x ?p ?o1 ?y ?o2
where {
  ?x ?p ?o1.
  ?y ?p ?o2.
  filter (?o1 > ?o2).
}
order by ?o1
limit 5</code></pre>

<p>

<h3>Slow Query Logging</h3>

<p>Stardog does not log slow queries in the default configuration, primarily because there isn't a sensible default meaning of "slow query", which is entirely relative to queries, access patterns, dataset sizes, etc. While slow query logging has very minimal overhead, what counts as a slow query in some context may be quite acceptable in another. To enable slow query logging, see the Stardog Server Properties discussion above.</p>

    <h2>Maintaining Search Indexes</h2>

    <p>Stardog's search service is described in the <a href="../using">Using Stardog</a> chapter.</p>

    <p>But managing the reindexing of search indexes is an administrative task.</p>

    <p>There are three modes for reindexing indexes:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><tt>sync</tt>: Recompute the search index synchronously with a transacted write.</li>
      <li><tt>async</tt>: Recompute the search index asynchronously as soon as possible with respect to a transacted write.</li>
      <li>Scheduled: Use a <a href="http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.1.x/tutorials/crontrigger">cron expression</a> to specify when the search index should be updated.</li>
    </ol>


    <p>This is specified when creating a database by setting the property <tt>search.reindex.mode</tt> to "sync", "async", or to a valid cron expression. The default is "sync".</p>

    </section>

    <section id="optimizing-bulk-load"><header><h1 id="chapter">Optimizing Bulk Data Loading</h1></header>

    <p>Stardog tries hard to do bulk loading at database creation time in
the most efficient and scalable way possible. But data loading time can vary
widely, depending on factors in the data to be loaded, including the number
of unique resources, etc. We'll continue to improve bulk loading as we move
to the 1.0 release; for now, here are some tuning tips that may work for
you:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Load <a href="#compressed">compressed data files</a> since compression minimizes disk access</li>
    <li>Use a multicore machine since bulk loading is highly parallelized and every index is built concurrently.</li>
    <li>Load multiple files together at creation time since different files will be parsed and processed concurrently improving the load speed</li>
    <li>Turn off <a href="#jvm-arg"><tt>strict.parsing</tt></a>.</li>
    <li>If you are not using named graphs, use <a href="#index-strategies">triples only indexing strategy</a></li>
  </ol>

    </section>

    <section id="resource-requirements"><header><h1 id="chapter">Resource Requirements for Stardog</h1></header>

    <p>The three system resources used by Stardog are CPU, memory, and
disk. In what follows we primarily discuss memory and disk. Stardog will
take advantage of multiple CPUs, cores, and core-based threads in data
loading and in throughput-heavy or multi-user loads. And obviously Stardog
performance is influenced by the speed of CPUs and cores. But some workloads
are bound by main memory or by disk I/O (or both) more than by CPU. In
general, use the fastest CPUs you can afford with the largest secondary
caches and the most number of cores and core-based threads of execution,
especially in multi-user workloads.</p>

    <p>The following subsections provides more detailed guidance for the
    memory and disk resource requirements of Stardog.</p>

    <h2>Memory usage</h2>

    <p>Stardog uses system memory aggressively and the total system
    memory available to Stardog is typically the most important factor in
    performance. Stardog uses both JVM memory (known as heap memory) and
    also the operating system memory outside the JVM (known as non-heap
    memory). Having more system memory available is always good; however,
    increasing JVM memory too close to total system memory is not usually
    prudent as it will tend to increase Garbage Collection (GC) time in the
    JVM.</p>

    <p>The following table shows minimum recommended JVM memory and system
memory requirements for Stardog:</p>

	<table dir="ltr" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="20%" summary="Stardog memory usage">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Number of triples</th>
          <th>JVM memory</th>
          <th>System memory</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>10 million</td>
          <td>2GB</td>
          <td>4GB</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>100 million</td>
          <td>3GB</td>
          <td>8GB</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1 billion</td>
          <td>4GB</td>
          <td>16GB</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>10 billion</td>
          <td>8GB</td>
          <td>64GB</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
      <caption>Recommended memory resources for a Stardog database.</caption>
    </table>

    <p>By default, Stardog CLI sets the maximum JVM memory to 2GB. This
    setting works fine for most small to medium database sizes (up to
    100 million triples). As the database size increases, we recommend
    increasing JVM memory. You can increase the JVM memory for Stardog
    by setting the system property <tt>STARDOG_JAVA_ARGS</tt> using the
    standard JVM options. For example, you can set this property to
    <tt>"-Xms4g -Xmx4g"</tt> to increase the JVM memory to 4GB. We recommend
    setting the minimum heap size (<tt>-Xms</tt> option) as close to the max
    heap size (<tt>-Xmx</tt> option) as possible.</p>

    <h2>Disk usage</h2>

    <p>Stardog stores data on disk in a compressed format. The disk space
    needed for a database depends on many factors besides the number of
    triples, including the number of unique resources and literals in the
    data, average length of resource identifiers and literals, and how much
    the data is compressed. The following table shows average disk space
    used by a Stardog database:</p>


	<table dir="ltr" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="20%" summary="Stardog disk usage">
      <thead>
        <tr>

      <caption>Average amount of disk space used by a Stardog database.</caption>
    </table>

    <p>These numbers are given for information purposes and the actual disk
    usage for a database may be significantly different in practice. Also it
    is important to note that the amount of disk space needed at creation
    time for bulk loading data is higher as several temporary files will be
    created. The additional disk space needed at bulk loading time can be
    40% to 70% of the final database size.</p>

    <p>Disk space used by a database is non-trivially smaller if <a href="#index-strategies">triples only indexing strategy</a>
    is used. Triples-only indexing reduces overall disk space used by 25% in average; however, please note the tradeoff: SPARQL queries involving named graphs perform significantly better with quads indexing.</p>

    <p>The disk space used by Stardog is additive for multiple databases and
    there is very little disk space used outside the databases. To calculate
    the total disk space needed for multiple databases, one can simply sum
    up the disk space needed by each database.</p>

  <section id="using-windows"><header><h1 id="chapter">Using Stardog on Windows</h1></header>

  <p>Stardog provides Windows batch (<tt>.bat</tt>) files for use on
  Windows; they provide roughly the same set of functionality provided by
  the Bash scripts which are used on *nix systems. There are however, a few
  small differences between the two. You cannot change the logfile with
  the global <code>--logfile</code> option using the .bat scripts, it will
  always just log to the console. Additionally, when you start a server with
  <code>server start</code>, this does not detach to the background, it will
  run in the current console.</p>

  <p>To shut down the server correctly, you should either issue a
  <code>server stop</code> command from another window, or press CTRL-C (and
  then response 'Y' when asked to "Terminate batch job"). <u>Do not under any
  circumstance close the window without shutting down the server. This will
  simply kill the process without shutting down Stardog which could cause
  your database to be corrupted.</u> </p>

  <p>The .bat scripts for windows support our standard
  <code>STARDOG_HOME</code> and <code>STARDOG_JAVA_ARGS</code> environment
  variables which can be used to control where Stardog's database is stored
  and usually, how much memory is given to Stardog's JVM when it starts. By
  default, the script will use the JVM that is available in the directory
  from which Stardog is run via the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment
  variable. If this is not set, it will simply execute <code>java</code>
  from within that directory.</p>

  <h2>Running Stardog as a Windows Service</h2>

  <p>You can run Stardog as a Windows Service using the following
configuration. Please, note, that the following assumes commands are
executed from a Command Prompt with administrative privileges:</p>

  <h3>Installing the Service</h3>

  <p>Change the directory to the Stardog installation directory:</p>

  <pre><code>cd c:\stardog-@@VERSION@@</code></pre>

  <h3>Configuring the Service</h3>

  <p>The default settings with which the service will be installed are</p>

  <ul>
    <li>2048 MB of RAM</li>
    <li><tt>STARDOG_HOME</tt> is the same as the installation directory</li>
    <li>the name of the installed service will be "Stardog Service"</li>
    <li>Stardog service will write logs to the "logs" directory within the installation directory</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To change these settings, set appropriate environment variables:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>STARDOG_MEMORY</tt>: the amount of memory in MB (e.g., set <tt>STARDOG_MEMORY</tt>=4096)</li>
    <li><tt>STARDOG_HOME</tt>: the path to <tt>STARDOG_HOME</tt> (e.g., set <tt>STARDOG_HOME</tt>=c:\stardog-home)</li>
    <li><tt>STARDOG_SERVICE_DISPLAY_NAME</tt>: a different name to be displayed in the list of services (e.g., set <tt>STARDOG_SERVICE_DISPLAY_NAME</tt>=Stardog Service)</li>
    <li><tt>STARDOG_LOG_PATH</tt>: a path to a directory where the log files should be written (e.g., set <tt>STARDOG_LOG_PATH</tt>=c:\stardog-logs)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><u>Note: if you have changed the default administrator password, you also need to modify <tt>stop-service.bat</tt> and
  specify the new username and password there (by passing <tt>-u</tt> and <tt>-p</tt> parameters in the line that invokes
  <tt>stardog-admin server stop</tt>). </u> In one of the future releases, an alternative solution will be provided that avoids
  the need to encode the administrator's password in the file.</p>

  <h3>Installing Stardog as a Service</h3>

  <p>Run the <tt>install-service.bat</tt> script.</p>

  <p>At this point the service has been installed, but it is not running. To
run it, see the next section or use any Windows mechanism for controlling
the services (e.g., type <tt>services.msc</tt> on the command line).</p>

  <h3>Starting, Stopping, and Changing Service Configuration</h3>

  <p>Once the service has been installed, execute
<tt>stardog-serverw.exe</tt>, which will allow you to configure the service
(e.g., set whether the service is started automatically or manually),
manually start and stop the service, as well as to configure most of the
service parameters.</p>

  <h3>Uninstalling the Stardog Service</h3>

  <p>The service can be uninstalled by running
<tt>uninstall-service.bat</tt> script.</p>
