Stardog Documentation
=====================

We write Stardog docs in raw-ish HTML5:

* Start a new chapter by cloning an existing chapter and tweaking it.
* Pick an Alan Perlis quote carefully!
* Be aware of the non-HTML5 markup conventions (powered by one of our JS libraries) for creating footnotes
* Be aware of the @@VERSION@@ macros we use
* Be aware that very long section titles break our (somewhat fragile) dynamic table of contents widget

If you're outside our org and are forking this repo to donate improvements to the Stardog docs,
first: thanks! Second, be aware of the above and make sure to ask questions if you need help.
