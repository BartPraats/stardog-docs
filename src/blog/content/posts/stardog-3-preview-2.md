In this second preview of Stardog 3 we focus on improvements to
reasoning and ICV capabilities.<!--more-->

## Know Equals? No Equals.

Stardog prior to the 3.0 release support query-time reasoning for OWL
and user-defined rules but equality reasoning was not supported. So if
you had `owl:sameAs` assertions in your database, they would not be
included in the reasoning results. Similarly axioms like `owl:hasKey`
would not be used by Stardog to infer new `owl:sameAs` inferences. One
reason for this omission is that the semantics of equality--equality
is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive--are inefficient in a query
rewriting approach.

Stardog 3 supports full equality reasoning by materializing
`owl:sameAs` inferences and thus offers a hybrid of materialized and
query-time reasoning capability. Equality inferences are automatically
computed and indexed so query rewriting can use this information in a
straight-forward way. Equality inferences are automatically updated
when the database contents are changed so they will always reflect the
latest state.

**Stardog 3 is the first and only graph database to support all of OWL
  2 and SWRL, including all of the OWL 2 profiles.**

## Repair Plans

Stardog provides proof trees to explain why an integrity constraint is
violated. Proof trees show in detail which assertions were involved in
the violation and how these assertions interact with each other. You
can use this information to correct errors and repair violations. But
if you are faced with the problem of cleaning up a messy dataset, then
you might be looking at many many violations that need to be fixed
and going over each proof serially is cumbersome.

Stardog 3 provides **automatically generated repair plans that will
fix a set of violations**. There are various configuration parameters
users can use to change what kind of repair plans will be
generated. For example, the default setting will try to minimize the
total number actions (additions or removals) required to fix all the
violations. So if removing a single triple could fix multiple
violations, it will likely be included in the repair plan since that
triple seems to contradict with many other assertions. Users can also
define custom metrics for generating repair plans.

The repair plans generated by Stardog can be saved as SPARQL update
operations so that they are portable and can be shared with external
parties easily.

## Reasoning Simplified

While Stardog supports all OWL 2 profiles (EL, QL, and RL), as well as
OWL 2 DL, that doesn't mean users should have to learn all the
ins-and-outs of these profiles. It's confusing and sometimes
frustrating to tease out the differences. Users like being able to
choose a reasoning level per query, but often didn't like having to
pick a particular kind of reasoning level.

In Stardog 3 reasoning levels have been radically simplified. Now you
just tell Stardog, per query, whether you want reasoning or not---true
or false; one or zero; yes or no. It's that simple. Stardog will
choose the most appropriate reasoning level if you request it; or it
will execute your query without any reasoning if you don't.

We think semantics simplified is the name of the game and we've put
our money where our mouth is for Stardog 3.
