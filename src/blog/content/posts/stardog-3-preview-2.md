In our preview of Stardog 3 we focus on improvements to
reasoning and ICV.<!--more-->

## Know Equals? No Equals.

Until the Stardog 3 release we supported query-time reasoning for OWL
and user-defined rules, but that didn't include equality reasoning. So
if you had `owl:sameAs` assertions in your database, they would not be
included in reasoning results. And axioms like `owl:hasKey` were not
be used to infer new `owl:sameAs` inferences. One reason for this
omission is that the semantics of equality---recall: equality is
reflexive, symmetric, and transitive---are difficult to implement
efficiently in a query rewriting system.

Stardog 3 supports full equality reasoning, by materializing
`owl:sameAs` inferences, and thus offers a hybrid of materialized and
query-time reasoning capability. Equality inferences are automatically
computed so that query rewriting can use this information in a
straight-forward way. Equality inferences are automatically updated
when the database contents are changed and always reflect the latest
state. **Stardog 3 is the first and only graph database to support all
of OWL 2 and SWRL, including all of the OWL 2 profiles.**

## Repair Plans

Stardog provides proof trees to explain why an integrity constraint is
violated. Proof trees show in detail which assertions were involved in
the violation and how these assertions interact with each other. You
can use this information to correct errors and repair violations.  If
you are faced with the problem of cleaning up a messy dataset, then
you might be looking at many violations that need to be fixed; but
examining each proof manually and serially is cumbersome.

Stardog 3 provides **automatically generated repair plans that will
fix a set of violations**. There are various configuration parameters
users can use to change what kind of repair plans will be
generated. For example, the default setting will try to minimize the
total number actions (additions or removals) required to fix all the
violations. So if removing a single triple could fix multiple
violations, it will likely be included in the repair plan since that
triple seems to contradict with many other assertions. Users can also
define custom metrics for generating repair plans.

The repair plans generated by Stardog can be saved as SPARQL update
operations so that they are portable and can be shared with other 
parties or systems easily.

## Reasoning Simplified

While Stardog supports all OWL 2 profiles (EL, QL, and RL), as well as
OWL 2 DL, that doesn't mean users should have to learn all the
ins-and-outs of these profiles. It's confusing and sometimes
frustrating to tease out the differences. Users told us that they like
to being able to choose a reasoning level per query, but often didn't
like having to pick a particular kind of reasoning level.

In Stardog 3 reasoning levels have been radically simplified. **Now
you just tell Stardog, per query, whether you want reasoning or
not**---true or false; one or zero; yes or no. It's that
simple. Stardog will choose the most appropriate reasoning level if
you request it; or it will execute your query without any reasoning if
you don't.

Making semantics simpler is good for everybody and we're on it.
