On 3 Feb, I'll be giving a talk about Stardog at the [Semweb Meetup in
NYC](http://www.meetup.com/semweb-25/calendar/15655768/).~

I'll publish my [slides](http://db.tt/Lqszdiz) for the talk here early next week so people won't
have to bother actually listening to me during the talk; rather, they can
tweet their brains out in a furious back-channel frenzy of love for Stardog.
Tweet, tweet! Woof!

Thanks to Marco Neumann for organizing the event and giving me a slot on the
program. I hope to see you there.
